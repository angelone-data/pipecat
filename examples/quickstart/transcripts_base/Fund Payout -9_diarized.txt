Agent: Good afternoon, this is Shobana Pandey speaking. How can I help you today?  

Customer: I have the account number and the client ID for Mr. Yogesh Pandey. The client ID is Y5 03 03 93 93 478 478.  

Agent: Thank you. I’ll verify a few security details.  

Customer: The last four digits of the registered mobile number are 7566. The email ID is yogesh.pandey858.8@email.com and the date of birth is 1985.  

Agent: Verification complete. What would you like to know about the client ID?  

Customer: I see a withdrawal request of ₹33,718 pending in my account. It says the funds will be withdrawn in one minute, but it’s still pending.  

Agent: Let me check your trading balance. You have a total of ₹1,19,525. Today you added ₹88,000, which is not part of the pending withdrawal. The remaining balance is ₹35,021.  

Customer: Is the ₹35,021 withdrawable?  

Agent: If the amount is used for trading it won’t be withdrawable, but the balance not used for trading can be withdrawn.  

Customer: Why is the ₹33,718 still pending?  

Agent: You initiated the withdrawal around 12 pm. It will be approved by 11:30 pm and credited to your FTSC bank account by that time.  

Customer: If I need more funds in the morning, will the amount be available after 11:30 pm?  

Agent: Yes. Withdrawals requested before 7 am are credited by 11:30 am the same day, provided no trades use the funds. If the funds are already traded, they will be credited after 24 working hours.  

Customer: So my ₹30,000 will be received by 11:30 pm?  

Agent: Correct. You can request withdrawals before 7 am for same‑day credit, or any time after 7 am for credit by 11:30 pm.  

Customer: That’s all I needed. Thank you.  

Agent: You’re welcome. After this call you’ll receive a feedback survey. Have a nice day.  

Customer: Thank you.
